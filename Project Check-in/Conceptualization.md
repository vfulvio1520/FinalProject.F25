## Musical Geoboard

My music-related software project will be a [geoboard](https://apps.mathlearningcenter.org) with which the user can draw shapes or overlay images that correspond to different audio parameters and generate audio and MIDI data.

---

### Objectives and scope

- Create a geoboard with a grid on which shapes can be drawn and images can be overlayed.
- Develop a database of stock sounds that can be generated and whose parameters can be changed in real time.
- Allow recording function, with audio and MIDI exports.

---

### Anticipated resources

- A React app that allows:
  - audio generation
  - geoboard manipulation
  - music theory
  - UI components
  - image path

---

### Timeline

- Gather and document functional requirements and assess scope (one week)
- Design the geoboard user interface; focus on audio/MIDI generation and parameter control (one week)
- Develop and document code iterations (one week)
- Test program and identify/fix bugs (one week)
- Deploy and provide access to working application (one week)
- Present final iteration, highlighting user experience and control, and referencing documentation throughout development process.
